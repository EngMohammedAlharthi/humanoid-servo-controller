# Humanoid Walking Algorithm

1. **Initialize**  
   - Set all servos to 90° (neutral standing position).

2. **Loop for each step**  
   1. **Lift right leg**  
      - Hip servo (right) → 60°  
      - Knee servo (right) → 120°  
   2. **Swing right leg forward**  
      - Hip servo (right) → 90°  
   3. **Lower right leg**  
      - Knee servo (right) → 90°  
   4. **Shift weight to right leg**  
      - (Optional) small adjustment on balance servos/arms  
   5. **Lift left leg**  
      - Hip servo (left) → 60°  
      - Knee servo (left) → 120°  
   6. **Swing left leg forward**  
      - Hip servo (left) → 90°  
   7. **Lower left leg**  
      - Knee servo (left) → 90°  
   8. **Shift weight to left leg**  
      - (Optional) small adjustment on balance servos/arms  

3. **Repeat**  
   - Continue alternating right/left steps until the robot reaches its goal.
